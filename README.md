# Line-following-robot 
This code is for the second pathway, it first creates all the variables,then runs through the main program which has startCount(); as the first function. This function works by having a condition where if both sensors detect a black line, there is a delay and then adds one to the line counter. The delay is there so that the robot does not count the line twice and the line counter counts the lines. It then moves forward and stop and adds one to the second counter which runs through 4 trails and breaks out of the 5th. Therefore the robot moves and stops every at a short interval so that I can physically see that the second counter actually counted. After it breaks out of startCount(); the program then chooses which position it should go towards according to how many lines it counted. Each position has many turn functions, the turning system for left and right 90 degrees happens with turnLeft90(); and turnRight90(); which use delays. The actual function which makes the robot move long the line is start();, which breaks about when it senses a black line. The turns which use the sensors are turnRightEff(); and turnLeftEff(); which keep on turning until it senses a black line. start8(); is used for the last turn as it moves forward and stops. All these functions are used in conjunction to go towards there targeted locations.
